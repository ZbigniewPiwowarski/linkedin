# linkedin webpage functional tests
- tests for anonymous user not logged in

# technologies used
- typescript
- webdriverIO
- mocha
- docker

# test principles
- every test is independent from each other
- every test runs on browser with clean cache
- tests attempt to be rather general to avoid maintaining costs 
    but to provide some level of safety for general features
    for not logged in user


# requirements
- docker https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

# how to run tests
